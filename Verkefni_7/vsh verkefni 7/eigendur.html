			<p>Snorri Freyr is the general manager of E&S News and owns the company alongside his friend and business partner, Eggert Geir. He is the head writer of the company and he decides what we write about and report on. But open minded too. He has always loved reading about the media and what has been going on in this interesting world of politics and entertainment. One day he had the idea of starting a news network with Eggert, and so they started working on E&S News, short for Eggert & Snorri News. Since 2016 they have been working on this exceptional news site free of any bias.</p>
